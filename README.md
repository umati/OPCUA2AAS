# OPCUA2AAS
OPC UA Server that can generate an Industry 4.0 Asset Admin Shell from its info model. 

The server is based on the Azure Connected Factory Solution Accelerator's production line station simulation and was extended by enabling the loading of OPC UA nodeset2.xml information model files and by enabling the generation of a Plattform Industrie 4.0 Asset Administration Shell from the OPC UA information model while keeping the information model intact.
